# SFS.md — `study-note` Solon SFS router

Solon SFS has two meanings. The terminal-facing `sfs` command is the Sprint Flow
System; the full Solon SFS is the Solo Founder System. This file is the shared
router for Claude, Codex, and Gemini.

Never paraphrase bash adapter output. Bash-first commands may still surface one
compact Next action after verbatim output. Never hardcode external private docsets.
In Solon reports, show gates as `Gate N (Name)`, not naked ids. Use gate
numbers 1..7 for new CLI examples; legacy ids remain compatibility-only.
