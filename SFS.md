# SFS.md — `study-note` Solon SFS router

Solon SFS has two meanings. The terminal-facing `sfs` command is the Sprint Flow
System; the full Solon SFS is the Solo Founder System. This file is the shared
router for Claude, Codex, and Gemini.

## 프로젝트 개요

- **이름**: `study-note`
- **유형**: `<PROJECT-TYPE>`
- **단계**: `<PROJECT-STAGE>`
- **환경**: `<PROJECT-ENVIRONMENT>`
- **핵심 산출물**: `<PROJECT-OUTPUT>`
- **공유/운영 방식**: `<PROJECT-DELIVERY>`

Read order:
1. `sfs context cat kernel`
2. `sfs context cat index`
3. Only the matching module from `sfs context cat commands/<name>.md` or
   `sfs context cat policies/<name>.md`

In thin layout, managed context lives in the packaged global `sfs` runtime.
`.sfs-local/context/` is optional project-local override space, not a normal
project document surface.

Default entry:
- `sfs status`
- current sprint `report.md` when one exists
- `docs/solon/<domain>/<subdomain>/<feature>/<yyyyMMdd>/` for domain-first
  shared adoption or handoff summaries when the product domain is known
- `docs/solon/<english-workspace>/<yyyyMMdd>/` as the legacy flat fallback
- expand to private workbench/logs only when the routed context needs evidence

Project overview refresh:
- `sfs profile` updates only this file's `## 프로젝트 개요` section.

Never paraphrase bash adapter output. Bash-first commands may still surface one
compact Next action after verbatim output. Compact output is quality-preserving only:
never compress evidence, risk warnings, decisions, source links/paths, or
raw-source traceability. If compactness would weaken quality, use full clarity.
Never hardcode external private docsets.
In Solon reports, show gates as `Gate N (Name)`, not naked ids. Use gate
numbers 1..7 for new CLI examples; legacy ids remain compatibility-only.
Solon reports should feel like compact console dashboards, not flat bullet
dumps: title/verdict strip, 2-4 labeled status panels, one action rail, and at
most 1-3 questions.
Decision questions must be self-contained: before any `Q1`, `D1`, or option
id, explain in plain user language what is being decided, why it matters, the
recommended default, and what each option changes. Labels are cross-references,
not the explanation.
Do not show a question/recommendation-only choice table. When multiple options
exist, show every viable option with its plain-language meaning and consequence,
then mark the recommendation as the default. If that is too much for one view,
ask one decision at a time instead of hiding alternatives.
Never ask the user to confirm a compact option bundle such as `A/A/A/C/C`, and
never answer "show the recommendation again" with only option labels or only
the recommended row. Re-present the decision in plain language and use a natural
confirmation phrase such as `권장안 그대로 확정`, not a label bundle.
When review returns partial/fail for a deterministic low-risk issue, complete
the loop instead of asking the user to request the next review: patch grep
scope, stale evidence, missing AC/file mapping, evidence path typos, and bounded
wording/document consistency in the same cycle, verify, then run the same-gate
review again. Ask the user only for product judgment: scope, architecture,
public contract, security/privacy/data-loss, cost/latency/model policy,
destructive behavior, or changed AC meaning.
Executable Action Ownership is part of the router contract: when shell/tool
steps are runnable and auth/runtime/approval are available, the agent runs them
and records evidence instead of handing the user copy-paste commands. Commands
are user-facing only when the user explicitly asks for them or a true blocker
exists: missing auth, unavailable tooling/runtime, sandbox or permission denial,
uncaptured destructive/data-loss/public-contract approval, or a materially
broader scope than authorized. If the user says `알아서 해`, `이번 세션은 진행`,
or grants autonomous deploy for this session, treat approval-gated steps inside
that stated scope as session-scoped authorization and continue until scope
changes or a true blocker appears. Shell state is agent-owned: use one-shot
inline env, mask secrets, and do not ask the user to export variables across
terminals.
For Solon commit grouping, guide users to the SFS command surface:
`sfs commit plan` and `sfs commit apply --group <name>` (Codex may use
`$sfs commit ...`; Claude slash routing may use `/sfs commit ...`). `sfs commit
apply` commits and pushes the current branch by default in user projects; use
`--no-push` only for local sandbox/release testing or offline work. Do not tell
users to use a host-local `/commit` skill for SFS work; `/commit` is not the
portable SFS workflow command.
Keep only what must remain: `.sfs-local/` is private active workbench state,
not durable history. `events.jsonl` stays visible only for the current sprint
ledger; stale/orphan events should be removed or archived by `sfs upgrade` /
`sfs tidy --all --apply`. Shared handoff/history docs prefer
`docs/solon/<domain>/<subdomain>/<feature>/<yyyyMMdd>/` and fall back to
`docs/solon/<english-workspace>/<yyyyMMdd>/` only when the domain labels are
unclear. Project-wide Solon reference docs may live under `docs/solon/`, and
step docs are created lazily. Repeated cleanup evidence is date-bundled under
`.sfs-local/archives/adopt/surface-cleanup/<yyyyMMdd>/surface-cleanup.tar.gz`.
