# SFS.md — `study-note` Solon SFS router

Solon SFS has two meanings. The terminal-facing `sfs` command is the Sprint Flow
System; the full Solon SFS is the Solo Founder System. This file is the shared
router for Claude, Codex, and Gemini.

## 프로젝트 개요

- **이름**: `study-note`
- **유형**: `<PROJECT-TYPE>`
- **단계**: `<PROJECT-STAGE>`
- **환경**: `<PROJECT-ENVIRONMENT>`
- **핵심 산출물**: `<PROJECT-OUTPUT>`
- **공유/운영 방식**: `<PROJECT-DELIVERY>`

Read order:
1. `sfs context path kernel`
2. `sfs context path index`
3. Only the matching module from `sfs context path commands/<name>.md` or
   `sfs context path policies/<name>.md`

In thin layout, managed context lives in the packaged global `sfs` runtime.
`.sfs-local/context/` is optional project-local override space, not a normal
project document surface.

Default entry:
- `sfs status`
- current sprint `report.md`
- expand to workbench/logs only when the routed context needs evidence

Project overview refresh:
- `sfs profile` updates only this file's `## 프로젝트 개요` section.

Never paraphrase bash adapter output. Bash-first commands may still surface one
compact Next action after verbatim output. Never hardcode external private docsets.
In Solon reports, show gates as `Gate N (Name)`, not naked ids. Use gate
numbers 1..7 for new CLI examples; legacy ids remain compatibility-only.
